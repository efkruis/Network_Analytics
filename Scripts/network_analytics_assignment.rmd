## Instructions

This assignment reviews the *Network Analytics* content. 
You will use the *network_analytics.Rmd* file I reviewed as part of the lectures for this week to complete this assignment. 
You will *copy and paste* relevant code from that file and update it to answer the questions in this assignment. 
You will respond to questions in each section after executing relevant code to answer a question. 
You will submit this assignment to its *Submissions* folder on *D2L*.
You will submit *two* files:

1. this completed *R Markdown* script, and 
2. as a first preference, a *PDF* (if you already installed `TinyTeX` properly), as a second preference, a *Microsfot Word* (if your computer has *Microsoft Word*) document, or, as a third preference, an *HTML* (if you did *not* install `TinyTeX` properly and your computer does *not* have *Microsoft Word*) file to *D2L*.

To start:

First, create a folder on your computer to save all relevant files for this course. 
If you did not do so already, you will want to create a folder named *mgt_592* that contains all of the materials for this course.

Second, inside of *mgt_592*, you will create a folder to host assignments.
You can name that folder *assignments*.

Third, inside of *assignments*, you will create folders for each assignment.
You can name the folder for this first assignment: *network_analytics*.

Fourth, create three additional folders in *network_analytics* named *scripts*, *data*, and *plots*.
Store this script in the *scripts* folder and the data for this assignment in the *data* folder.

Fifth, go to the *File* menu in *RStudio*, select *New Project...*, choose *Existing Directory*, go to your *~/mgt_592/assignments/network_analytics* folder to select it as the top-level directory for this **R Project**.

Make sure the senders are listed in this order.
Convert the *data table* to a *undirected* network named **team_net** using **graph_from_data_frame()**.

Create a new vertex **status** attribute in **team_net** for the nodes by setting **V(team_net)$status** to **c("R", "L", "R", "R", "U", "U", "R", "R", "L", "L", "L", "L")**.
Copy the **status** attribute into a **color** vertex attribute.
Then, convert an **R** into a **blue** color, an **L** into a **red** color, and an **U** into a **gray** color.

Create a vertex position matrix named **ver_pos** using **cbind()**.
Set the first column equal to **c(5, 25, 13, 1, 25, 5, 8, 20, 1, 15, 25, 13)**.
Set the second column equal to **c(20, 1, 23, 13, 16, 3, 10, 20, 25, 2, 10, 8)**.

Plot the updated **team_net** using **plot()**.
Set the edge labels to **NA** and color to **black**.
Set the layout to **ver_pos**.
Set the vertex labels to **V(team_net)$name** and label colors to **white**.
Set the vertex colors to **V(team_net)$color** and size to **35**.

(1) Did *Milena* leave?
(2) How many connections does *Vedran* have to individuals who *remain* versus *left* the team?
(3) How many individuals connect to *five* other teammates?

```

## Task 2: Relational Neighbor Classifier

For this task, you will compute the (probabilistic) relational neighbor classifier.

### Task 2.1

Compute the probability of individuals remaining in the team based on their neighbors.

First, convert **team_net** to a *long data frame* named **team_att** containing the node attributes.
Second, create **node_sender_summ** from **team_att** by: grouping by **from_name**, *summarizing* the number of individuals with remain, left, and unknown **to_status**, and *renaming* the variable **from_name** to simply **name**.
Third, create **node_receiver_summ** from **team_att** by: grouping by **to_name**, *summarizing* the number of individuals with remain, left, and unknown **from_status**, and *renaming* the variable **to_name** to simply **name**.
Finally, create **node_summ** by row binding the two data tables **node_sender_summ** and **node_receiver_summ**, group by **name**, sum across all variables, and compute via **mutate()** (1) the total number of connected collaborators who remain or left the team and (2) the probability of connected collaborators remaining with respect to the total number who remain or left the team.

Print **node_summ**.

**Questions 2.1**: Answer these questions:
(1) How many total collaborators with a known *status* are there for *Lazar*?
(2) What is the probability of *Vedran* remaining based on the relational neighbor classifier?

**Responses 2.1**: *WRITE YOUR ANSWER BETWEEN THESE ASTERISKS*.

```{r, task2_1}
team_att <- as_long_data_frame(team_net)

#summarizing the sender notes
node_sender_summ <- team_att %>%
  group_by(from_name) %>% 
  summarize(
    collab_remain = sum(to_status == "R"),
    collab_left = sum(to_status == "L"),
    collab_unknown = sum(to_status == "U")
    ) %>%
  rename(name = from_name)

#summarize receiver nodes
node_receiver_summ <- team_att %>%
group_by(to_name) %>%
  summarize(
    collab_remain = sum(from_status == "R"),
    collab_left = sum(from_status == "L"),
    collab_unknown = sum(from_status == "U") ) %>%
  rename(name = to_name)


#relational neighbor classifier
node_summ <- node_sender_summ %>%
  bind_rows(node_receiver_summ) %>% 
  group_by(name) %>%
  summarize(
    across(
      .cols = everything(),
      .fns = sum
      ),
    .groups = "drop" ) %>%
  mutate(
    tot_known = collab_remain + collab_left,
    remain_prob_known = collab_remain / tot_known
    )


node_summ
```

### Task 2.2

You will now compute a probabilistic neighbor classifier.

Now, consider an altered collaboration network by applying **plot()** to **team_net** with the layout set to **ver_pos**, the vertex color set to **gray**, and the vertex size set to **35**.

Next, extract the adjacency matrix of **team_net** and save it as **team_adj**.  
Set the seed of your computer to **1736**.
Create an initial probability vector of individuals remaining on the team represented by **team_net** named **remain_prob** by using **runif(12, 0, 1)**.
Set the names of the elements of **remain_prob** using **names()** and **V(team_net)$name**.
Print these initial probabilities.

Then, create a *for* loop to update the initial probabilities *twice*.
Update the probabilities by matrix multiplying **team_adj** with **remain_prob** and dividing by the *degrees* of each node.
This result should be added to **remain_prob**, and, then divided by **2**.
Make sure to overwrite **remain_prob** across the loops.
Print the updated probabilities.

**Questions 2.2**: Answer these questions:
(1) Did *Pavle's* initial probability *increase* or *decrease* after the updating?
(2) After updating, which individual is most likely to leave (i.e., has the smallest probability to remain)?

**Responses 2.2**: *WRITE YOUR ANSWER BETWEEN THESE ASTERISKS*.

```{r, task2_2}
#plotting network
plot(
  team_net,
  layout = ver_pos,
  vertex.color = "gray",
  vertex.size = 35
  )

#extracting adjacency matrices
team_adj <- as_adjacency_matrix(team_net)

set.seed(1736)

remain_prob <- runif(12, 0, 1)

names(remain_prob) <- V(team_net)$name

remain_prob


#for loop to iterate on intial probabilities
for (ndx in 1:2) {
  remain_prob <-

     degree(team_net) +
     remain_prob) / 2 
}

Break-up the vector into three lines of seven for reading clarity in your code.
Copy the **label** edge attribute to a **color** edge attribute.
Then, convert an **RR** into a **blue** color, an **LL** into a **red** color, and an **RL** into a **purple** color.

Plot the updated **team_net** using **plot()**.
Set the edge labels to **NA** and color to **black** and width to **3**.
Set the layout to **ver_pos**.
Set the vertex label colors to **white** and size to **35**.

Make sure to name the colors of each path inside of **geom_path()** for each model.
Add appropriate labels for the axes and legend.
Use **scale_color_manual()** to label the paths in the legend.
Use **theme_linedraw()** as the theme.
Position the legend at the bottom.
Display the plot.

Then, calculate the area under the receiver-operator characteristic (ROC) curve for **glm_3_probs** using **roc_auc()**.

Examine the results.

**Questions 8.4**: Answer these questions:
(1) What is the area under the ROC curve for this model?
(2) Which model predicts the best?

## Task 9: Save Objects and Plots

For this task, you will save some of the objects and plots created in this script.

### Task 9.1

Save the following objects into a single *RData* file named **employee_net_objects.rdata** in the **data** folder of the project directory:

1. **employee_tg**,
2. **employee_nodes**,
3. **employee_net_samp_plot**,
4. **glm_wrkflw**, and
5. **glm_1**, **glm_2**, and **glm_3**.

Save the three plot objects as **png** files into the **plots** folder of the project directory:

1. **employee_net_samp_plot** as **employee_net_samp.png**,
2. **employee_net_samp_facet_plot** as **employee_net_samp_facet.png**, and
3. **roc_plot** as **roc.png**.

Alter the *width* and *height* for the plots as needed.
